## About This Project
Laboratory Management is an application designed to facilitate the operations of a laboratory, specifically for the Physics study program. The application caters to two primary user roles: students and laboratory staff (laboran). It includes several features aimed at streamlining laboratory management and enhancing efficiency for both user types.

### Key Features
1. **Inventory Management (For Laboratory Staff)** 
   The inventory management feature allows users to effectively manage laboratory equipment and supplies. It provides functionality for tracking and organizing assets, ensuring that all items are accounted for and easily accessible. This feature includes the following categories:
   - **Equipment**: Laboratory staff can manage various tools and instruments, including adding new items, monitoring borrowings, and changing the status of damaged equipment. This ensures all equipment is well-maintained and accounted for.
   - **Supplies**: Manage consumable items and materials required for experiments, including monitoring stock levels and tracking usage to ensure smooth laboratory operations.
   - **Room Management**: Oversee the allocation and usage of laboratory spaces. Users can schedule and reserve rooms, ensuring optimal use of facilities while avoiding conflicts.

2. **Borrowing Management (For Laboratory Staff)**  
   The borrowing management feature allows laboratory staff to monitor and manage the borrowing of equipment and rooms. This feature provides:
   - **Equipment Borrowing**: Laboratory staff can track the borrowing of equipment by students, displaying detailed information about each borrowing transaction, including the items borrowed, borrowing dates, and return deadlines.
   - **Room Borrowing**: Manage the reservation and borrowing of laboratory spaces, ensuring that rooms are allocated efficiently and that students adhere to usage schedules. Staff can monitor room availability and handle any conflicts that may arise.
